# memome
I want a chrome extension app to manage my memos on surfing and links. I don't know when and how.

### Maybe
1. It has multiple backends. Ex. Github
2. It stores data in chrome local db and sync to backends.
3. It just collects, collects. The data should be synced to and managed by another app.
4. It will be a mess of code for a long time. So that I can improve it without any responsibilities.
